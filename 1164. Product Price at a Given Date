Write a solution to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16. Assume the price of all products before any change is 10.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct product_id, 10 as price
from Products
where product_id not in 
# need to not have a chnage date before that date
(select distinct product_id 
from Products 
where change_date <= '2019-08-16')

union

select distinct product_id, new_price as price
from Products
where (product_id,change_date) in
(select product_id, max(change_date)
from Products
where change_date <=  '2019-08-16'
group by product_id)
