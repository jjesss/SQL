For this problem, we will consider a manager an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.

Write a solution to report the ids and the names of all managers, the number of employees who report directly to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.


# Write your MySQL query statement below
select manager.employee_id, manager.name, 
sum(if(employee.reports_to is not null,1,0)) as reports_count,
round(avg(employee.age),0) as average_age
from Employees manager left join Employees employee
on manager.employee_id = employee.reports_to
group by manager.employee_id
having count(employee.reports_to) >=1
order by employee_id
